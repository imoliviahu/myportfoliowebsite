    <div id=hello> Hi! </div>
    <div id=aboutme> I am <b>Olivia Hu</b> , a sophomore at Parsons School of Design studying Communication Design in New York City. I was born in Manhattan and grew up in New Jersey with my parents, younger sister, and guinea pig. I enjoy spending time with family and friends, dancing, listening to music, eating at restaurants, painting, drawing, and singing. I have also lived in China for three years during middle school so I speak Chinese fluently. I do good in anything I set my mind to and I am looking forward to new opportunities!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div>
