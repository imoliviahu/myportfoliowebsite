    <div id=hello> Hi! </div>
    <div id=aboutme> I am Olivia Hu, a sophomore at Parsons School of Design studying Communication Design in New York City. I enjoy spending time with family and friends, dancing, listening to music, painting, sketching, and anything involving my creativity. I have a younger sister, mom, dad, and guinea pig named Sammi, who live in New Jersey. I have lived in China for three years during middle school so I speak Chinese fluently. I am grateful for the experiences in life I have had so far and cannot wait to discover more. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div>
