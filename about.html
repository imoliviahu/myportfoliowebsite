        Hi, I'm Olivia :)
      </h1>

      I'm from New Jersey and lived in Beijing, China for about two and a half years in middle school, 
      where I became fluent in Chinese. I used to take many art classes as a child where I picked up my fundamental skills and passion for art and design.
      <br><br>Currently, I am a junior in Communication Design(BFA)
      at Parsons School of Design with a background in graphic design, website design, and illustration. 
      I would love to gain experience in designing brand identities, developing websites, and 
      gaining knowledge in UX/UI design. If you want to know and see more about me, you can find me 
      here via <a href="https://www.instagram.com/imoliviahu/">Instagram</a> & <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivia-hu-artist/">Linkedin</a>.
