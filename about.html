        Hi, I'm Olivia Hu
      </h1>

      I'm from New Jersey and lived in Beijing, China for about two and a half years in middle school, 
      where I became fluent in Chinese. I used to dance competitively from 
      ballet to hiphop. Alongside dance, I also found my passion for art. I took many art 
      classes as a kid and eventually decided to pursue art as a career. 
      <br><br>Currently, I am a junior in Communication Design(BFA)
      at Parsons School of Design with a background in graphic design, website design, and illustration. 
      I would love to gain experience in designing brand identities, developing websites, and 
      gaining knowledge in UX/UI design. If you want to know and see more about me, you can find me 
      here via <a href="www.instagram.com">Instagram</a> & <a href="www.linkedin.com">Linkedin</a>.
