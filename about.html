        Hi, I'm Olivia Hu.
      </h1>

      I was born in Manhattan and grew up in New Jersey for majority as a child. I lived in Beijing, China for about two and a half years, attending school and becoming fluent in my mother language. 
      I used to dance competitively from ballet to hiphop. Alongside dance, I also found my passion for art. I took many drawing classes as a kid and eventually decided to pursue art as a career.  
      <br><br>Now, I am a sophomore studying a BFA in Communication Design
      at Parsons School of Design with a background in graphic design, web design, and illustration. I would love to gain experience in designing content
      for brands and developing knowledge in UX/UI design. If you want to know more about me, you can find me here via <a href="www.instagram.com">Instagram</a> & <a href="www.linkedin.com">Linkedin</a>.
